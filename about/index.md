I am a senior software engineer at [Unavco](http://unavco.org).  My primary focus is on writing highly reliable systems for retrieving geodetic data from places with not very reliable communications.  Most of our systems are written in Python, with a Postgresql backend, but these days I am doing more and more frontend javascript work, which I have fully embraced.


While I enjoy programming immensely, I also have a number of other hobbies including music (guitar and a bit of banjo), woodworking, and electronics.


I am based in the beautiful state of Maine, so if you're here for the lobster, foliage, beaches, or what have you, be sure to say hello.
